One recommendation is required; however, the admissions committee will accept up to two recommendations. Select a recommender who is qualified to evaluate your potential for leadership or management. He or she should have a strong understanding of your abilities and be familiar with solid examples of your accomplishments. This individual may be a current or past supervisor or manager, a client or vendor, or a representative of a volunteer or community organization in which you are involved.

You will enter your recommender’s name and email address into your application. The recommender will then receive an email with a link to your recommendation form. The recommendation forms are submitted separately from your application upon its completion. You should not wait for your recommender to submit his or her recommendation before submitting your application; however, your application will not be reviewed without the recommendation form.
